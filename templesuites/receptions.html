                Need to hold a wedding reception? We've got you covered! We have many options for hosting 
                receptions, and you can find all the details below. Contact us if you'd like to start planning!

                    <h2>The Reception Hall</h2>
                    <p>Our reception hall is a large, spacious area that can accomodate even the largest of receptions. 
                    There's no need to worry about space, that's for sure! Our hall is also left generally undecorated, 
                    as we recognize different couples usually calls for different decor. As such, we have many decoration 
                    options for you to utilize, or, if you don't like our options, feel free to bring your own! We want your 
                    happy day to be perfect, so decorate how you please!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="colored reception-food">
                    <h2>Food</h2>
                    <p>Need food? We've got options for that as well! We have a catering staff at the ready to help prepare some 
                    truly remarkable foods, and you can leave the work to them! More info on our catering can be found elsewhere on this page. Rather get food from elsewhere? We allow other catering 
                    services to be hired for use in our reception hall! Get whatever food you want, because once again, we want your 
                    happy day to be perfect! In fact, if you'd rather make the food yourself, the reception hall is connected to a large, 
                    versatile kitchen where numerous people can cook at once! Family recipes are perfect for these things, after all.</p>

                    <h2>Setup</h2>
                    <p>Do you have a grand idea for your reception setup, but not the skills and/or desire to do it? good thing we have 
                    a setup crew! All you need to do is tell the crew what you want, and let them get to work! If you have personal decorations 
                    you want used, just make sure to give them to the crew before they start so they can actually decorate! Now isn't that easy?</p>

                    so all you need to worry about is telling us what you want! Want a specific type of food, like Italian or Chinese? We can do it! 
                    Want a hodge-podge of all kinds of foods? We can do it! Rather leave the decision to us? We can even do that! Though we can't promise
