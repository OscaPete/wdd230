            <p>the UDOT home page has an immediate display of contrast. The background is dark, due to being a set of roads, 
                but sitting in the front is a white search bar, accompanied by orange, yellow, and blue, all in a bright, almost pastel shade. 
                This brightness on top of the dark backing is impossible to pass off as not contrast.

        <div class="visual-hierarchy">
            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>

            <p>When you open this page, you are met with a large, purple block with information on it. It almost looks like 
               it's the only thing there, but it becomes obvious pretty quickly that that's not the case. This is visual hierarchy 
               at work, where something that is large and has a good amount of contrast to everything else grabs your attention first.

        <div class="rule-thirds">

            <p>This example of the rule of thirds on BoxLunch's home page lies a short ways down the page, but it is there 
                nonetheless. Both at the top and bottom of the screenshot, you can see sets of three in a row, causing most to 
                mentally envision three columns, one for each item. You have the "Shop Safe" icons at the bottom, which all have 
                nice consistency too, and at the top we see three different covers for airpod cases.
